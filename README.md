# Echoes of Pharloom

Echoes of Pharloom is a focused study companion that combines session tracking, ambient feedback, and motivational tools to help users stay engaged and consistent with their learning routines. The platform is designed with modularity, offline resilience, and future scalability in mind — combining a React-based frontend, serverless backend services, and cloud-native infrastructure as code.

### 🧠 Overview

Echoes of Pharloom connects a user’s study sessions with structured feedback loops.  
- The **frontend** manages user sessions, audio ambience, streaks, and UI flows.  
- The **backend** handles persistence, authentication, and feedback routing.  
- The **infrastructure** provisions all cloud resources declaratively.

This architecture enables modular iteration across each layer while keeping deployment and data flow transparent for both developers and contributors.
